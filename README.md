### Prerequisites

The first thing you need to do is create a file called index.html 
because thats where you start writing your code, after that making a css 
file thats where all your design goes, and then you comeback to your html file, 
and you start with doctype language and after you can start building your title, head, body, and after all you need link your css into main html page
otherwise anything you do in css wont apply for html


### Style test
